For my final project in Linear Algebra, my group and I researched the Netflix reccomendation algorithm, and how it uses matrices to find similar tastes and preferences in movies and shows for users. Our Matlab program simulates the collaborative filtering process, and represents these "likes" and "dislikes" in the form of a matrix.
