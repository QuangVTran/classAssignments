CS 4720, Design and Analysis of Algorithms

In this course, I learned about the fundamentals of Algorithms, with time complexity being the most important aspect.

For homework, I implemented two forms of sorting: quick sort, and merge sort, which both run at O(nlogn) time complexity, which is vasty superior and faster to typical quadrative time complexity O(n^2) sorts such as selection sort and bubble sort.
